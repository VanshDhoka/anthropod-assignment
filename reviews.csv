"Overrated and pretentious. The plot is filled with holes and the dialogue is clunky and full of exposition. The 'love' explanation was just silly.",negative,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/

"I found it incredibly boring. Long stretches of people talking about physics followed by more talking. The pacing is glacial. I almost fell asleep.",negative,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/

"A frustrating experience. For every interesting idea, there are two dumb ones. The sound mixing was also terrible; I could barely hear the dialogue over the loud music.",negative,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/

"All spectacle, no heart. The film is technically impressive but emotionally vacant. I was never invested in the stakes or the characters' fates.",negative,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/
